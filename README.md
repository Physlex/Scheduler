# GraniteBox

## Overview

This project defines the GraniteBox micro-kernel linux-as-a-framework application development kit.

That's a lot of keywords, so let's break it down into some specifics.


### GraniteBox

GraniteBox (or GBox) is an application development toolkit used to implement cross-platform applications, using an *honest* open-source software license, and without the restrictions that come typical of other equivalent modern application development kits.
